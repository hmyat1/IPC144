One benefit of using this feature is we can save time and it reduce the code complexity which is beneficial while writing large programs. 	One negative reason of using this feature is that it can be challenging for other 	developers to comprehend how the function operates and how to use it correctly if 	different output methods are used inconsistently throughout the code.2. ConvertLbsKg is one function that indicates weak cohesion. It alters the original argument value of pounds put in and returns the converted value after converting a value in pounds to kg. The original value that was provided as an argument shouldn't be changed by this method; it should only be in control of conversion. The function should only return the transformed value; the original value should be left alone in order to increase cohesiveness.	ConvertLbs is one function that indicates coupling that might be improved. Although it 	implements the conversion factor for pounds to kg, which is defined in the w8p2.h 	header file, it converts a value in pounds to gram. As a result, there is a close coupling 	between the two functions. Both functions must be modified if the conversion factor 	changes. The convertLbs function should accept the conversion factor as an argument to 	improve coupling and make it more adaptable and flexible of other functions.3. The advantages are code reusability and improve readability.	Instead of giving the complete structure by value, one can pass data to functions more 	effectively by using pointers. This is due to the fact that sending huge structures by value 	can be high in terms of memory and processing. Instead of copying the full structure, 	one can use pointers to provide the function a memory address.
