1. No, I don’t have any previous programming experience. I think C programming language is the most basic language of all other programming languages. 2. Compiling process means converting the written codes into a machine language which a machine can understand and to perform the instructions of the written codes.3. I want to understand the basic ideas of the C programming language and I want to be able to write the C program at the end of the course.
