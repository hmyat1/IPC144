1. In the previous workshops, I didn’t know the importance of indentation and my codes were not indented but, in this workshop, I realised it and tried to write my codes clearer to read and understandable by indenting.2. I think without the nested logic, the code is going to be so messy and complex This would make it harder to understand the logical flow and make the code less readable.3. The alternative path if/else if is far better than using a series of if optional path. Using a series of if will be hard to extend the logic and it will create unnecessary complexity while writing and maintain the code.
