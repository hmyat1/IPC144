When working with arrays, the for loop is generally the preferred iteration construct. This is because arrays have a fixed size, and we often know in advance how many times we will need to iterate over the array. The for loop allows us to use the index of the array to access each element, and to easily control the number of iterations. It is also more efficient than using a while loop, as we can take advantage of the fixed size of the array to avoid unnecessary checks.2.Both testing and debugging are important parts of software development. To test a program, we can create test cases that cover different scenarios and inputs and compare the actual output with the expected output. To debug a program, one can use a debugger tool to step through the code and inspect variables and expressions or use print statements and logging to track the program's execution and output. By following these approaches, we can find and fix errors in the programs and improve their quality and reliability.3. Firstly, we have to open the output file output.txt and locate line 6, which is causing the error. The error message indicates that the expected output is "Enter your monthly NET income: $0", but the actual output is "Enter your monthly NET income: $5567.89".Then we have to compare the expected and actual output character by character, starting from the first character of the output. The error message indicates that the character in column 33 is supposed to be ASCII code 48, which corresponds to the character "0", but the program printed ASCII code 53, which corresponds to the character "5Ó. After that we have to identify the line of code in the program that is responsible for printing the incorrect character. In this case, it is likely that the program is not initializing the variable for monthly NET income correctly or is using the wrong value to print the output. We have to modify the code to correctly initialize the variable for monthly NET income, or to use the correct value to print the output. Then we have to re-run the program and generate a new output file output.txt and verify that the output now matches the expected output in line 6. Then only we can submit the new output file for grading and verify that the submission is successful.
